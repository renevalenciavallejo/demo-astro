        successors and assigns and all of their respective officers, directors,

        Parties relating in any way to the Site, the services offered on the
        Site (the “Services”) or these Terms will be resolved by binding
        arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you and the Company
        Parties may assert individualized claims in small claims court if the
        claims qualify, remain in such court and advance solely on an
        individual, non-class basis; and (2) you or the Company Parties may seek
        equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of
        intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain
        names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration
        Agreement shall survive the expiration or termination of these Terms and
        shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were
        asserted before you agreed to these Terms (in accordance with the
        preamble) or any prior version of these Terms. This Arbitration
        Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of
        federal, state or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows,
        seek relief against the Company Parties on your behalf. For purposes of
        this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also include disputes that
        arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any
        prior versions of the Agreement as well as claims that may arise after

        applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et
        seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration
        Agreement and any arbitration proceedings. If the Informal Dispute
        Resolution Process described above does not resolve satisfactorily
        within 60 days after receipt of your Notice, you and Company agree that
        either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through
        binding arbitration. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the
        interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. The
        arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative
        dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims
        with an amount in controversy under $250,000, not inclusive of
        attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’ most current
        version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at

        800-352-5267. A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide
        the other party with a request for arbitration (the “Request”). The
        Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address,
        e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username
        (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any
        applicable account; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted
        and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy
        sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in
        controversy in United States Dollars; (4) a statement certifying
        completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described

        signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s
        knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable
        under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented
        for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or
        needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims,
        defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by
        a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing
        law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages
        contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified,

        available to an individual party under applicable law, the arbitral
        forum’s rules, and these Terms (including the Arbitration Agreement).

        decision not to render an award) is based, including the calculation of
        any damages awarded. The arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The

        request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for
        relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in

        These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding
        the use of the Site. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or
