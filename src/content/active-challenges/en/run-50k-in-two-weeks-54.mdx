## Description

Accumulate at least 50K of running from November 11th to 24th. Join this challenge and get your registration fee back by completing it. The prize pool will be distributed among those who achieve the goal.

- End: <ChallengeDate date={frontmatter.endTime} lang={frontmatter.lang} dateFormat={ChallengeDateFormat.Long} client:load />
- Duration: <ChallengeDuration startTime={frontmatter.startTime} endTime={frontmatter.endTime} lang={frontmatter.lang} client:load />

## Pot

The prize pool is generated by summing up the registration fees paid by each participant. It is distributed equally among those who achieve the challenge goal, with Swetro retaining 20% of the prize pool before distribution.

The more participants there are in a challenge, the larger the prize will be.
