## Description

Accumulate at least 60K of running in two weeks. Join this challenge and get your registration fee back by completing it. The prize pool will be distributed among those who achieve the goal.

## Date

- Start: <LocalDate dateUtc={frontmatter.startTime} client:load />
- End: <LocalDate dateUtc={frontmatter.endTime} client:load />

## Pot

The prize pool is generated by summing up the registration fees paid by each participant. It is distributed equally among those who achieve the challenge goal, with Swetro retaining 20% of the prize pool before distribution.

The more participants there are in a challenge, the larger the prize will be.
