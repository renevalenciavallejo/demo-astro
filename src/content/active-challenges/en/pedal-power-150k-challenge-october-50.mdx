## Description

Accumulate at least 150K of outdoor cycling in one week. Join this challenge and get your registration fee back upon completion. The prize pool will be distributed among those who achieve the goal.

## Date

- Start: <LocalDate dateUtc={frontmatter.startTime} client:load />
- End: <LocalDate dateUtc={frontmatter.endTime} client:load />

## Pot

The more participants there are in a challenge, the larger the prize will be.
